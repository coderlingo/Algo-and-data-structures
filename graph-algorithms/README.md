# Graph algorithms
The section is divided into 3 sections. All on the basis of the different use cases of the different graph algorithms 
###Minimum spanning tree(MST)
* Prim's Algorithm
* Kruskal's Algorithm

These algorithms see a use in building the network topology on the basis of link traffics. 
These algorithms, especially Kruskal's works on disjoint sets data structures to generate the
edges for the graph.

###Traversal Algorithm 
* Breadth first search 
* Depth first search 
     #### Tree Traversal 
* Inorder traversal 
* Pre order traversal 
* Post order traversal 

BFS, DFS even though have search in their names are different approaches of traversing a graph.
<i>Level order traversal</i>is another name for BFS. Inorder, Pre-order and Post order are traversal algorithms specific to a tree data 
structure.

###Shortest path algorithms
* DAG 
* Bellman ford
* Dijkstra's
* Floyd's
* BFS (un-weighted)

These algorithms are most used, like the name suggests in finding the shorted path in  a graph. Each of them have conditions in which they perform better than the other.
